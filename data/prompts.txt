# Generate sentences.csv

I'm studying japanese. Help me by generating a file called "sentences.csv" that contains a japanese sentence, its hiragana pronounciation, and its english translation. Here is an example "sentences.csv" file:

japanese,hiragana,english,vocabularies
今日は暑い日です,きょうはあついひです,Today is a hot day,暑い|日
昨日は雨が降りました,きのうはあめがふりました,It rained yesterday,昨日|雨
私の家は広いです,わたしのいえはひろいです,My house is spacious,家|広い

Can you generate a file called sentences.csv that specifically shows off sentences that utilize the "だ - to be, is" grammar point? Here are some sample sentences:

私だ。
綺麗だ。

I want sentences.csv to contain at 10 sentences.
